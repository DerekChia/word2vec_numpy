# Word2Vec Implementation using Numpy

This is a implementation of Word2Vec using numpy. Click [here](https://derekchia.com/an-implementation-guide-to-word2vec-using-numpy-and-google-sheets/) for the accompanying blog post.

To see Word2Vec in action, uncomment the print functions! Also remember to change the number of `epochs` and set `training_data` to `training_data[0]` to avoid flooding your terminal. A Google Sheet implementation of Word2Vec is also available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mgf82Ue7MmQixMm2ZqnT1oWUucj6pEcd2wDs_JgHmco/edit?usp=sharing). Have fun learning!
